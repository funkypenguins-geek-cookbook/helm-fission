# When applying updates, Kubernetes defaults to an update strategy of "RollingUpdate"
# However, when RWO storage is involved, this can cause the update to get "stuck", as the
# "old" pod is not terminated until the "new" pod is healthy, but the "new" pod needs the storage
# currently attached to the "old" pod, in order to start. As a result, the "new" pod is never healthy
# The resolution here is to set the strategy to "Recreate", which will first terminate the "old" pod,
# before attempting to start the "new" pod.

## Router config

  ## For minikube, set this to NodePort, elsewhere use LoadBalancer or ClusterIP.
  serviceType: LoadBalancer

  ## Used if the router is exposed via NodePort
  nodePort: 31314
  
  ## Display endpoint access logs
  ## To be aware of enabling logging endpoint access log, it increases
  ## router resource utilization when under heavy workloads.
  displayAccessLog: false
  
  ## Add annotations for router
  # svcAnnotations:
  #   cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: Internal
  
  ## For router to match encoded path.
  ## If true, "/foo%2Fbar" will match the path "/{var}";
  ## Otherwise, it will match the path "/foo/bar".
  useEncodedPath: false
  
  roundTrip:
    ## If true, router will disable the HTTP keep-alive which result in performance degradation.
    ## But it ensures that router can redirect new coming requests to new function pods.
    ##
    ## If false, router will enable transport keep-alive feature for better performance.
    ## However, the drawback is it takes longer to switch to newly created function pods
    ## if using newdeploy as executor type for function. If you want to preserve the
    ## performance while keeping the short switching time to new function, you can create
    ## an environment with short grace period by setting flag "--graceperiod" (default 360s),
    ## so that kubernetes will be able to reap old function pod quickly.
    ##
    ## For details, see https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/723
